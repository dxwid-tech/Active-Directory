# Active-Directory

## Objective

In this project, the goal was to create an Active Directory environment to learn about how to manage users, groups, security policies and networks. I also decided to use Sysmon and Splunk to generate and collect telemetry from brute force attacks from Kali Linux. This was so that I could learn how to inestigate events using an SIEM platform like Splunk.

### Skills Learned

- Downloading and configuring multiple Virtual Machines.
- Hosting a domain controller to manage users and groups.
- Setting up Sysmon and Splunk Universal Forwarders to collect events.
- Performed brute force attacks to gain access to target windows machine 
- Investigated events on Splunk server
- 

### Tools Used

- Virtual Box for hosting the virtual machines.
- Splunk and Sysmon for logging events.
- Windows server to act as Domain Controller.
- Ubuntu server to run Splunk.
- Kali Linux for simulating attacks on target machine using crowbar.

## Key Steps
These are the most important steps and results that I collected throughout this projects.
